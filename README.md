# Welcome to Mendoza's Deep Learning Portfolio

Hi! I'm **Monique Antoinette R. Mendoza**, a Data Science student currently studying Deep Learning and Analytics. This portfolio serves as a comprehensive collection of my laboratory activities and lecture tasks developed throughout the course. It reflects my journey in exploring how intelligent systems can be trained to learn, adapt, and make decisions from data.

##  Portfolio Overview

This Jupyter Book is organized into several key sections that highlight both theoretical understanding and practical implementation:

- **Laboratory Activities:**  
  Step-by-step coding exercises and experiments using deep learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).  
  These activities strengthened my foundation in building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

- **Lecture Tasks:**  
  Reflections and summaries from lecture discussions that bridge theoretical concepts with real-world applications in AI and data science.

## Tools & Technologies

This portfolio was developed using:
- **Python** – for data analysis and model implementation  
- **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** – for deep learning model construction  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – for interactive coding and visualization  
- **Jupyter Book** – for organizing and publishing my work
